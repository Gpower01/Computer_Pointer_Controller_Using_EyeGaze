# Computer_Pointer_Controller_Using_EyeGaze
 The Computer Pointer Controller is an application that is being developed to control the mouse pointer of the computer system using gaze estimation model. This application uses Inference Engine API from Intel's OpenVino Toolkit and it was tested on CPU, GPU, VPU and FPGA Devices to determine the best device suitbale for deployment. To build this application, the gaze estimation model required three inputs included in the README.md file
